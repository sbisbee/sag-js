Sag-JS Changes
==============

Version 0.5.0
-------------

New Features

  * Use JSON when creating a session with CouchDB so we don't have to deal with
    URL encoding issues.

Fixed Bugs

  * The callback for `login()` now passes the correct, documented arguments.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

New Features

  * Adding 'skip' and 'key' parameters to the getAllDocs() options. Thanks to
    Simon Metson for the patch (github/drsm79).

  * You can now specify SSL when using Node. Doesn't do anything when running
    in the browser.

  * Adding function to get active tasks from '/_active_tasks'.

Fixed Bugs

  * Fixed serverFromURL() in Node v0.4.x.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

New Features

  * You can now initialize your server connection with a URL by using
    sag.serverFromURL(). For example,
    sag.serverFromURL('http://user:pass@user.cloudant.com/db') would be the
    same as using the server() constructor, then login(), and then
    setDatabase().

  * Implemented the toString() function on the server() API to return a full
    URL. For example, it might return 'http://user:pass@user.cloudant.com/db'.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

New Features

  * All of the thrown exceptions are now Error's instead of strings. Closes #1.

  * Introduction of `on('event', callback)` which allows you to create global
    event handlers. Currently the only event supported is 'error' whose
    callback gets the response object as its parameter. For example, you can
    make a global error handler by specifying
    `sag.on('error', function(resp) { ... });`. Closes #5.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

First release, complying with Sag v0.7.1's API.
